You are helping a job candidate improve their resume by exploring skill gaps.

Generate a natural, conversational question to ask about the following skill gap. The goal is to
help the candidate recall if they have any relevant experience with this skill that might not be
reflected in their current resume.

Skill gap:
- Skill: {skill}
- Category: {category}
- Importance: {importance}
- Context: {context}

Guidelines:
- Ask in a friendly, conversational tone
- Be specific about what kinds of experience would be relevant
- Give 1-2 concrete examples of what might count as relevant experience
- Keep the question concise (2-3 sentences max)

Example output format:
"Have you worked with [skill] in any capacity? This could include things like [example 1] or [example 2]."

Generate only the question, no additional text.
