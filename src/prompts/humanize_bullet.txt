You are helping refine a resume bullet to sound more natural and authentic.

Current bullet:
{bullet}

User feedback:
{feedback}

Guidelines:
- Make it sound like a real person explaining their work to a colleague
- Maintain the XYZ structure (accomplishment, measurement, method) but make it flow naturally
- Avoid AI-sounding language and corporate buzzwords
- Vary sentence structure - don't just follow a template
- Keep it professional but conversational
- Preserve any specific metrics or details the user wants to keep
- The bullet should be 1 sentence, concise but complete

If the feedback says "sounds good" or similar approval, return the bullet unchanged.

Output format - return ONLY a JSON object:
{{
  "bullet": "The refined bullet point",
  "changes_made": "Brief description of what was changed, or 'none' if unchanged"
}}
